"After 20 returns","Just writing a rare review on these . I love Nike’s but my feet don’t usually. So I’ve ordered and returned a lot. Tried again lol and these ARE AMAZING comfortable. So much that I may order 3 more this year just to have them. The color is so cute and clean and sporty. I’m 99.9% sure I’ve dinally found a pair of Nikes I’m not going to return , fingers crossed 🤞😊","08 May 2019","Size: 10 Color: White/Metallic Silver/Dark Grey","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717EKthL0BL._SY88.jpg","Yes","sherlain miranda","4.0","Nike Women's Reax Run 5 Running Shoes","https://www.amazon.com/Nike-Womens-Reax-Running-Shoes/product-reviews/B07ZPL752N/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Half size up :)","I have only run in them a couple of times, but so far they feel great. I normally wear a size 9, and I ordered a 9.5, and I’m glad I did. There is plenty of room, but not too much. The only thing that will take me getting used to is that they are slightly bulkier than my ASICS. Like any running shoes, I’m sure it will take a little bit of time to work out the stiffness and fully break them in, but they are amazing!","14 Dec 2018","Size: 9.5 Color: White/Metallic Silver/Dark Grey","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ap+mslLBL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Blondie","5.0","Nike Women's Reax Run 5 Running Shoes","https://www.amazon.com/Nike-Womens-Reax-Running-Shoes/product-reviews/B07ZPL752N/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Surprisingly comfortable","I have a very hard time finding shoes that are comfortable for me, I have severe fibromyalgia with no help from medications because nothing works for me. So I am constantly looking for comfortable clothing and sneakers. Usually nike isnt good for me but after deciding to give this pair a try I was happy I did. Not only are they nice looking but they really are comfortable. I wore them all day today did a lot of walking and have zero issues with my feet hurting.

"Great, Comfortable Shoe","This is my second pair.  They are the most comfortable tennis shoes I own, I can be on my feet all day and they don't hurt.  I normally wear a 8.5 but in this shoe I wear a 9.  I find the toe box is wider and more comfortable especially if I wear a little thicker sock, it's just roomy enough to my toes are scrunched together.  I don't have a wide foot either.","18 Jul 2017","Size: 9 Color: White/Metallic Silver/Dark Grey","","Yes","msgrnbay","5.0","Nike Women's Reax Run 5 Running Shoes","https://www.amazon.com/Nike-Womens-Reax-Running-Shoes/product-reviews/B07ZPL752N/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Loving these shoes","I'm really loving these shoe's. A little pricey. I'm on my feet a lot for work plus I  jog. I've worn them three times now and they're very comfortable. I wear a 6 1/2, purchase a 6 1/2, fits perfect. I like my shoes a little wide in the toe area.

"4GB RAM NOT 8GB RAM!","This is NOT an 8GB RAM! It is only 4GB RAM! With that being said, it is advertised as an 8GB RAM, packaging was basically triple boxes, packaged very well! Came with backpack and mouse pad as described. Initial start up was slow, but moving fast now that it’s set up. Only gave 3 stars because the RAM is a significant part in purchasing the right laptop!","26 Nov 2019","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71T29bOsioL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Atara83","3.0","2019 HP 15.6 Inch HD Premium Business Laptop PC, Intel Dual-core i3-7100U, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB HDD, USB 3.1, HDMI, WiFi, Bluetooth, Windows 10, W/ Legendary Computer Backpack & Mouse Pad Bundle","https://www.amazon.com/HP-Business-Dual-core-Bluetooth-Legendary/product-reviews/B07VMDCLXV/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Great Laptop, Good Value, well worth it","Amazon delivered my order promptly. This laptop bundle came in a solid double packaging, and it comes with a backpack and a mouse pad. I am so amazed by the backpack & mouse pad quality, and I don’t mind the little legendary logo both accessories. I had HP laptops previously and had been pleased with their performance. This one is exceptional for someone who isn't into a lot of gaming and such. I am self employed and I bought this laptop for my work, I only need basic internet browsing and need to do some basic excel reporting, so this computer is perfect for me and at an amazing price, especially it came with bonus accessories.","03 Sep 2019","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61+EuNBo3AL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Maggie","5.0","2019 HP 15.6 Inch HD Premium Business Laptop PC, Intel Dual-core i3-7100U, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB HDD, USB 3.1, HDMI, WiFi, Bluetooth, Windows 10, W/ Legendary Computer Backpack & Mouse Pad Bundle","https://www.amazon.com/HP-Business-Dual-core-Bluetooth-Legendary/product-reviews/B07VMDCLXV/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Nice, but faulty!","I got a faulty laptop from day 1! Before I ordered I made sure to ask the seller if it’s NEW.  Well, I got it and it shuts down every 2 minutes. They offered refund, but I live outside the US and returning this mess will cost me a lot. I thought it was tested/upgraded as stated. How can they missed mines when it shuts off right after start up?  Now I’ve trust issues with purchasing electronics online now.","02 Nov 2019","","","Yes","Candice","1.0","2019 HP 15.6 Inch HD Premium Business Laptop PC, Intel Dual-core i3-7100U, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB HDD, USB 3.1, HDMI, WiFi, Bluetooth, Windows 10, W/ Legendary Computer Backpack & Mouse Pad Bundle","https://www.amazon.com/HP-Business-Dual-core-Bluetooth-Legendary/product-reviews/B07VMDCLXV/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Pretty much everything that i was looking for in a large laptop","the box delivered on time and safe.  it was double boxed and packed well. the included laptop bag is good quality and will work well when i need to use it.  i would not buy this laptop for the bag but it is a nice value add. speed and response on this laptop is everything that i was looking for.  set up was easy and came 1/2 charged so i didn't have to immediately plug in. My only concern is battery life.  this is the largest laptop that i have ever had.  i use mainly for school and work.  i don't game or stream a lot of video.  but in the 4 hours that i have had the laptop open today, the battery has already dropped to 25%.  i don't know if that is to be expected with the multiple windows open and the large screen but i don't expect to get 8 hours out of the charge if i am on it.  I will keep the power cable near by.  if you are using less, you might make a full day on a charge.","31 Oct 2019","","","Yes","Gregg Stepp","4.0","2019 HP 15.6 Inch HD Premium Business Laptop PC, Intel Dual-core i3-7100U, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB HDD, USB 3.1, HDMI, WiFi, Bluetooth, Windows 10, W/ Legendary Computer Backpack & Mouse Pad Bundle","https://www.amazon.com/HP-Business-Dual-core-Bluetooth-Legendary/product-reviews/B07VMDCLXV/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Worst purchase of 2019!","Extremely dissatisfied with this laptops lack of speed and how low quality it looks and feels. It truly behaves like a 13 year old slow laptop and I have high speed internet. It lags and takes forever to turn on it is so slow that I can get most info on my cellphone so much faster. I tried twice to get Amazon to send me a new Factory sealed one and they sent two that had the security tape removed and laptop was not factory packed. If it wasnt too late to return this I would do it in a heartbeat!
